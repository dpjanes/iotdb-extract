    At the end of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto's social media video
    touting the free trade breakthrough between the U.S. and Mexico, he held up
    three fingers saying what Mexico really wants is a deal "between Mexico, the
    U.S. and Canada, in which we all win."


    That gesture echoed his comments Monday via speakerphone with U.S. President
    Donald Trump.


    Trump clearly wanted to use the moment to isolate Canada. But Pena Nieto
    didn't; in fact, he kept insisting that it's time to bring Canada into the
    deal.


    Was Mexico's leader living up to his commitment not to make a deal without
    Canada? Or was he trying to salve his guilty conscience, knowing he's
    already thrown Canada under the bus?


    Perhaps it was a bit of both.


    In the early days, the question seemed to be whether Canada would throw
    Mexico under the bus and make a bilateral deal with the U.S.


    In February 2017, Mexico's Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray and its Secretary
    of Economy Ildefonso Guajardo visited Toronto and received reassurances
    Canada wanted to work with Mexico.


    "NAFTA is a three-country agreement," Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister
    Chrystia Freeland said. "Were there to be any new negotiations, those would
    be three-way negotiations."


    Former prime minister Brian Mulroney chimed in on CBC News Network's Power &
    Politics: "Throwing friends and neighbours and allies under the bus is a
    position for a weak leader," he told then host Rosemary Barton. "This is not
    the Canadian tradition."


    But the message was not always consistent. Trudeau often referred to
    Canada's desire for a three-way "win-win-win" deal, while also stressing his
    job was to protect Canada's interests. (Subtext: not Mexico's.)


    The Mexicans picked up on the ambiguity. Mexico's former deputy foreign
    minister Andres Rozental wrote in the Globe and Mail that "Mexicans are also
    perplexed by some of the recent calls in Canada for 'dumping' Mexico from
    NAFTA and negotiating a bilateral deal with Washington. This is both
    short-sighted and a mistake."


    Trudeau continued to walk that line.


    Former Mexican president Vicente Fox said Trudeau's messaging left the
    Mexican side unsure how much it could count on Canada.


    Speaking to CBC Radio's The Current, he said Trudeau often spoke in favour
    of three-way deal, but "that was one day.


    "The other day he had to defend Canadian interests. And that's OK. It's
    business, it's trading and you have to look for a good deal, you have to
    negotiate, you have to concede and look to get good things back from the
    other."


    "At the very beginning Prime Minister [Justin] Trudeau said he would protect
    Canadian interests even if Mexico was not there. And at the end of the
    picture, it happened the opposite."


    In the early days of the Trump administration it was widely assumed Mexico
    would be the real target of the U.S.


    "They're principally focused on countries that have large trade deficits
    with them," said Canada's ambassador to the U.S. David MacNaughton. "They
    haven't said anything specific about real problems they have with us."


    Trump's presidential campaign focused on Mexico and China as the trade
    villains stealing American jobs. Trump barely referred to Canada during the
    campaign, except to say "I love Canada" when asked whether he wanted a wall
    on the northern border.


    Few foresaw how Canada's dairy industry would become Trump's poster child
    proving that NAFTA is "the worst deal ever," as the president likes to call
    it.


    Nothing he said prepared his supporters for concluding a new free trade deal
    with Mexico, while leaving Canada on the sidelines — nothing has, really,
    been "concluded" with Mexico just yet, and Trump's base seems barely to have
    noticed the turnaround.


    It is no secret to anyone involved in the talks that the Mexicans were
    keener to get something signed than the Canadians, not least because Andres
    Manuel Lopez Obrador, a leftist, is set to become Mexico's next president.


    Having worked up his base over Canada's dairy tariffs, Trump may have
    concluded it made sense to reach a deal with Mexico and use that as a hammer
    to hit Canada — so he offered Mexico a deal it couldn't refuse.


    While current Mexican officials continue to express their hope that Canada
    will rejoin, Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray was blunt about his country's
    calculations.


    "There are things that we don't control, particularly the political
    relationship between Canada and the U.S., and we definitely don't want to
    expose Mexico to the uncertainty of not having a deal. Not having a trade
    agreement with the U.S., that's a substantial risk to the Mexican economy.
    Literally millions of jobs in Mexico depend on access to the U.S. market."


    Rozental, Mexico's former deputy foreign minister, told CBC Radio's As It
    Happens he regretted his country's rush to conclude a deal without Canada.


    "I believe that the Canadian government has put a brave face on what in
    effect is, from my point of view, a very unfortunate situation."


    "We decided that Mexico and the United States would negotiate, bilaterally,
    rules of origin for the automotive sector and Canada felt that it wasn't
    necessary for it to be at the table because it would benefit from whatever
    agreement was reached between the two of us.


    "What I don't think anybody expected was that right after having discussed
    the rules of origin for the cars, all of a sudden, we started negotiating
    bilaterally with the United States on everything else, on all the pending
    issues — sunset clauses, dispute settlements, intellectual property,
    governmental procurement etc., without the presence of Canada."


    Rozental says all three countries carry some of the blame for the situation
    but that it's Mexico's attitude that pains him.


    "I think that we, in Mexico, should have insisted on having Canada with us,
    because even when NAFTA was first negotiated, the Canada-Mexico partnership
    helped both of us a great deal in discussing with the United States
    proposals which we considered to be then and now unacceptable."


    Fox told CBC he hopes Canada and Mexico can continue to work together.


    "Usually, we get together when we're going to meet the elephant in the room
    between us. It's been useful for the two of us to defend ourselves
    together."
