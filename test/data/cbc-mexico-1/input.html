Trudeau often referred to Canada&#x27;s desire for a three-way &quot;win-win-win&quot; deal, while also stressing his job was to protect Canada&#x27;s interests. (Subtext: not Mexico&#x27;s.)</span></p><p><span>The Mexicans picked up on the ambiguity. Mexico&#x27;s former deputy foreign minister Andres Rozental wrote in the Globe and Mail that &quot;Mexicans are also perplexed by some of the recent calls in Canada for &#x27;dumping&#x27;Â Mexico from NAFTA and negotiating a bilateral deal with Washington.
