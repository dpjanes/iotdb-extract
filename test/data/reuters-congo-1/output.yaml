  name: Congo's controversial voting machines start arriving
  document: >-
    KINSHASA (Reuters) - Congo’s deputy prime minister said on Saturday that
    tablet-like voting machines for December’s election had been made to order
    and will finish arriving this month, despite suspicions by diplomats and the
    opposition that they may enable fraud.

    President Joseph Kabila is due to step down after 17 years in power after a
    long-delayed vote scheduled for Dec. 23 to choose his successor.

    The election, which was meant to happen before Kabila’s mandate expired in
    2016, had been delayed for so long that many doubted it would happen.

    If it goes ahead, it will be Democratic Republic of Congo’s first peaceful
    transition of power since independence from Belgium in 1960.

    This year, crucial milestones of the calendar — such as candidate
    registration — have been passed on time.

    “A hundred and eighty containers from South Korea with the machines in them
    are on the sea,” Vice Prime Minister and Security Minister Henri Mova
    Sakanyi said in a statement, adding that 15 had already arrived and the rest
    would arrive by the end of October.

    The introduction of electronic voting and the authorities’ exclusion of a
    number of candidates from the ballot — such as exiled opposition leader
    Moise Katumbi and former Vice President and acquitted war crimes suspect
    Jean-Pierre Bemba — has prompted opposition leaders to cry foul.

    The electoral commission says the machines will cut costs and speed up the
    counting of votes in the vast central African country where past elections
    have been marred by voting irregularities or violence.

    Critics say they are much more vulnerable to vote-rigging than paper and ink
    and could be compromised by the unreliability of Congo’s power supply,
    especially in remoter parts of its vast, forested territory. Sakanyi said a
    shipment of solar panels to run them was also on the way.

    Although Kabila is not running, he has thrown his weight behind former
    interior minister Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary.

    Sakanyi said vehicles needed to distribute election materials, such as
    trucks and helicopters — many parts of Congo have no roads — would arrive on
    Saturday.

    He noted that there remained serious challenges to sticking to Congo’s
    electoral calendar, including insecurity in parts of the country that had
    led to electoral officials being kidnapped in two incidents, and the Ebola
    epidemic in the east.
